<h2>Why passphrases?</h2>

<p>Passwords are hard.
Humans are notoriously bad at coming up with passwords, and typical "secure" passwords are a mess to remember and to type... And worst, they're not even secure.</p>
<p>This JavaScript demonstration generates random passphrases, which are much more secure than most passwords, and much easier to remember and type.</p>

<h3>Passphrase benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li>Secure: This tool picks a random passphrase out of more than 16 trillion possible passphrases (in technical terms, 44 bits of entropy).
At 1000 guesses per second, an attacker will need 260 years on average to guess the password.</li>
<li>Easier to remember:
A passphrase of four English words, even if it's non-sense, encourages the brain to come up with its own mnemonic device, which aids retention.
<a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">(Obligatory XKCD.)</a></li>
<li>Easier to type:
The passphrase, while longer than an equivalent password, only consists of letters.
Touch typists will benefit from staying close to home row, and everybody benefits from having a passphrase that is largely keyboard layout agnostic.
For instance, the keys stay the same whether you're using a PC or a Mac.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Any downsides?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Many applications require passwords to contain digits and/or special characters.
Obviously, an unmodified passphrase is not applicable.</li>
<li>Some applications limit password length for absolutely no valid reason.</li>
<li>Worst of all, a few applications <i>silently</i> truncate long passwords, effectively only checking the first one or two words of your passphrase.
To defend against this, you should verify that it is not possible to log in using only the first three words of your passphrase.</li>
</ul>

<h3>I've found an application that silently truncates passphrases; what now?</h3>

<p>The security of the application is broken beyond belief, and you should
1) avoid using the application and
2) track down the person responsible and burn down their house.
Go now! No jury in the world will convict you.</p>


<h2>Notes on producing quality passphrases</h2>

<p>Generating a good random passphrase is more complex than just picking random words from a dictionary.
The word list used here is 2027 words, carefully selected according to two criteria.</p>

<h3>Picking only common words</h3>

<p>Passphrase generators have a tendency to include the most obscure words available in the English language; but to most people, "datary grebe hyoscine cerement" is as much gibberish as "AYaG53srw".</p>

<p>This passphrase generator only uses words that are reasonably common in English.
There is no reason to go for obscure English words to improve security; indeed, obscure words just makes the passphrase less memorable (especially for people who are not native English speakers).</p>

<p>For a list of common words in modern English, a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Wiktionary:Frequency_lists&oldid=15589879#TV_and_movie_scripts">frequency list based on TV
and movie scripts</a> was consulted, and only the top 6000 words were considered for inclusion.
Doubling the number of words, by considering the top 12,000 words, would only add 4 bits of entropy.</p>
<p>If greater security is desired, just going from four to five words adds 11 bits of entropy.</p>

<h3>Avoiding offensive words and phrases</h3>

<p>This is more difficult, as demonstrated by the search results one gets for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=offensive+CAPTCHA">"offensive CAPTCHA"</a>.
The example of a site requesting a user to type "don't type" is at the very mildest end of the spectrum.</p>

<p>As demonstrated by the same results, stringing random letters together without constructing offensive words is by no means easier, and filtering the usual four-letter words is not nearly enough; the human mind can be incredibly creative in finding double entendres in the most innocent of sentences.</p>

<p>For this reason, the word list used here only includes nouns (and no proper nouns).
The lack of verbs and adjectives makes it much more likely that the result will be a meaningless string of words, rather than a meaningful sentence.</p>

<p>In addition, the word list has been culled of words that reference crime, violence, anatomy, sexuality, religion, drugs, family relations, illness and death.</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>For more information, including a Python implementation, and word lists (both good and bad), see <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kwi/password-generator/">the project page on Bitbucket</a>.
Here you can also report bugs, such as the inevitable offensive passphrase you discovered after clicking "Have another" for half an hour.</p>
